1. USAGE INSTRUCTIONS                                        *vim-todo-usage*

At the moment plugin supports only keyboard shortcuts
presented in |vim-todo-settings| and can be adjusted for needs. 
Defaults are in |vim-todo-defaults|.

Current state presents actions:
    - adding element to list:
        Adds element to the very end of the list, gets input from |input|,
        uses `todo#add`,

    - deleting element from list:
        Deletes element from under the cursor, without warning, uses
        `todo#delete`,

    - renaming element in list:
        Renames element from under cursor, adds new date stample, gets input
        from |input| and gives a prompt with current data from todo, uses
        `todo#rename`,

    - saving to global file as well as retrieving information from it:
        On normal quit using mappings `todo#quit` or `todo#quit2`,
        Todos are saved to file using Icon script which is precompilled on
        Unix like machine. 
        If you want to quit without saving changes use `:q<CR>`which will not
        save changes,

    - checking and unchecking elements from list:
        Changes state of todo element from checked to unchecked and from
        unchecked to checked. Date of the element states as to when was the
        last rename or creation, uses `todo#check`.
