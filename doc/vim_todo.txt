1. USAGE INSTRUCTIONS                                        *vim-todo-usage*

At the moment plugin supports only keyboard shortcuts
presented in |vim-todo-settings| and can be adjusted for needs. 
Defaults are in |vim-todo-defaults|.

Enable/disable can be achieved by setting: ``g:todo#enable`` to 1 or 0.


Current state presents actions:
    - adding element to list:~
        Adds element to the list, gets input from |input|:
        - `todo#add` adds element after current line , 
        - `todo#addAtLast` adds element at end of the list,
        - `todo#insertBefore` adds element before current line, 
        - `todo#insertAtBeg` adds element at the beginning of list,

    - deleting element from list: ~
        Deletes element from under the cursor, with warning, uses
        `todo#delete`,

    - renaming element in list: ~
        Renames element from under cursor, adds new date stample, gets input
        from |input| and gives a prompt with current data from todo, uses
        `todo#rename`,

    - saving to global file as well as retrieving information from it: ~
        On normal quit using mappings `todo#quit` or `todo#quit2`,
        Todos are saved to file using Icon script which is precompilled on
        Unix like machine. 
        If you want to quit without saving changes use `:q<CR>` which will not
        save changes,

    - checking and unchecking elements from list:~
        Changes state of todo element from checked to unchecked and from
        unchecked to checked. Date of the element states as to when was the
        last rename or creation, uses `todo#check`.
